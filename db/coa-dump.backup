8	Wedu Global Fisa 	4	2019-08-01	 We envision a world where half of leaders in every sector are women. Our mission is to nurture the leadership potential of women across Asia by providing mentorship, learning tools and access to innovative financing options to complete higher education. To date we have served 1,313 women from 25 countries in Asia, managed over 30,000 hours of mentorship and we are pioneering the use of Future Income Sharing Agreements (FISA) to fund education in Asia.\n	Cambodia, Thailand, Nepal, Bangladesh 	With CoA, we will be able to expand our FISA offering and fund the education of many more talented women across Asia. Most importantly, we want to prove together that FISA can be a financially sustainable tool to fund education and thereby attract urgently needed new funders (investors and donors) in this vital space, mobilise much larger resources and eventually create a market for financing education that will support the dire need of human capital development across developing and emerging countries in Asia.\n \nWe are just starting to see the impact of our unique approach combining leadership development and investment in education. We are actively looking for partners to help us expand our operating capacity so we can make needed investments in technology, talent and expand distribution networks for both leadership development and financing for education. Only with those investments we will be able to reach thousands more women and meaningfully contribute to create a world where each woman has a fair chance at becoming the leader she deserve to be	1 Year 	rejected	100000	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5PF6KAPTgpaRuch5v3PS5jxceescqNklhHkHpSeXBE/edit?usp=sharing	27	\N	/home/atixlabs/files/server/projects/8/milestones.xlsx	/home/atixlabs/files/server/projects/8/pitchProposal.pdf	/home/atixlabs/files/server/projects/8/agreement.docx	12	2020-03-10 10:38:00.052-03	12	\N	\N	\N

4	Yellow Leaf Hammock 	3	2019-08-01	Yellow Leaf Hammocks is a home & outdoor lifestyle brand centered around relaxation, driven by positive impact. They are aiming to break the cycle of extreme poverty through sustainable job creation by supporting artisan weavers and their families were previously trapped in extreme poverty and debt slavery. We work with inspiring companies such as Yellow Hammock to ensure that they obtain the strategic capital they need as well as to track the impact that has been made in local communities. \n\nThe Impact \n360 jobs have been created\n4000 units is the annual consistent amount of hammocks produced per quarter\n300 weavers have been contracted \n16,800,000 Baht has gone to the community\n1500 Children have been put into school\n\nAnd these statistics are only expected to increase.\n	Thailand 	“There are still more than a billion people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $1.25 a day. In Thailand alone, more than a million members of hill tribes exist on the margins of society - denied citizenship, shut out of the formal job market and vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking. \n\nAt Yellow Leaf Hammocks we believe that ethical job creation is an empowering long-term solution to extreme poverty. Instead of organizing a patchwork of charitable donations to provide water, nutrition, clothing, etc., we are working directly with families to build a comprehensive, dignified, long-term strategy toward a brighter future. The causes behind systemic poverty are complicated, but long-term financial stability is within reach. To put it simply: By focusing on livelihoods, we can cut out the middle man, get money directly into the hands of smart + resourceful mothers and empower families to tackle their own problems (without being subject to anyone else's agenda). Across three weaving communities, we are working to create jobs for mothers and build a foundation for positive community transformation. Through flexible, safe “prosperity wage” weaving work, our artisans are able to lift their families from poverty and debt slavery to the middle class. Creating jobs for women is especially important to community transformation - research shows that women will spend up to 90% of their earnings on the health, nutrition and education of their families. Turning women into breadwinners improves their status in the community, builds self-esteem and enables them to pool resources to improve infrastructure.”\n	1 year 	rejected	50000	https://docs.google.com/document/d/11qbxo5H4jk-FOVtQ5BA6Q3I6oD0RxC3tGzXnhquBbP4/edit	7	\N	/home/atixlabs/files/server/projects/4/milestones.xlsx	/home/atixlabs/files/server/projects/4/pitchProposal.pdf	/home/atixlabs/files/server/projects/4/agreement.docx	12	2020-03-10 10:45:21.335-03	12	\N	\N	\N

15	Dengue Prognostic Test	18	2019-09-16	StratifiCare™ was founded in 2015 with the vision of empowering personalized medicine for tomorrow through our innovative diagnostic solutions.	Dengue-endemic Countries	 Due to the lack of advanced medical technology, physicians find it hard to provide individualized treatment for patients. This may result in less optimal clinical outcomes and usage of healthcare resources. By developing technologically advanced in vitro diagnostic solutions, we transform the way patients are managed through personalized care and create value for all. Our early clinical study have shown that we are able to effectively reduce Dengue hospitalization by as much as 67%. This translates to an annual global cost savings of US$4.5 billion, most of which directly benefit Dengue-endemic developing countries. We are trying to solve the problem of over-hospitalization of Dengue patients. Up to 60% of all Dengue patients are hospitalized and this causes severe bed shortages during large Dengue outbreaks, especially in developing countries. Non-emergency procedures and elective surgeries are postponed/cancelled. The situation is further exacerbated when majority of hospitalized Dengue patients do not require any medical procedure and can recover on their own, while other Dengue patients rejected from hospitalization due to bed shortages may develop Severe Dengue and succumb to the disease outside hospital care. We are developing the world's first Dengue prognostic test that can accurately predict which Dengue patient will develop Severe Dengue and requires hospitalization, and which patient will not and can be outpatient.	0.5 year	rejected	100000	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KaB6balTuOZgUzUln6F2yxO_1zVZOUp5_eAanMkoSSM/edit	43	\N	/home/atix/Descargas/Comparaciones.xlsx	/home/atixlabs/files/server/projects/15/pitchProposal.docx	/home/atixlabs/files/server/projects/15/agreement.pdf	12	2020-02-14 12:34:00.034-03	12	\N	\N	\N
